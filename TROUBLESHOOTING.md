# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting: Date Error Fix

If you're experiencing the "date.getTime is not a function" error, this is because localStorage contains old data where dates were stored as strings instead of Date objects.

## Quick Fix

**Option 1: Clear Browser Storage**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear(); window.location.reload();
   ```

**Option 2: Use the Clear Storage Script**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Copy and paste the contents of `clear-storage.js` into the console
4. Press Enter and refresh the page

**Option 3: Manual Clear**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find Local Storage â†’ localhost:3000
4. Delete these keys:
   - `auth-storage`
   - `chat-storage`
   - `theme-storage`
5. Refresh the page

## What This Fixes

The error occurs because:
- Zustand persist middleware stores dates as ISO strings in localStorage
- When the app loads, these strings aren't converted back to Date objects
- The utility functions expect Date objects with `.getTime()` method

The fix ensures that dates are properly handled regardless of their storage format.

## Prevention

The updated `utils.ts` now includes:
- Type-safe date conversion functions
- Fallback handling for invalid dates
- Support for Date objects, strings, and numbers

This should prevent similar issues in the future!
